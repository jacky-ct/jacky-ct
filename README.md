## Hey what's up

I'm a software dev currently working in the wind industry on some fun stuff -- mostly your bog standard full stack stuff (TS, JS, Express, ReactRedux etc) but also some ML/DevOps as well. Wish I could share more but most of it is trapped behind my work GH and general industry secrecy ðŸ¤«

I'm currently learning
- Functional programming with Haskell
- Rust by developing some CLI tooling
- General good practices by reading more real books (thank you kindle)
- How to stop obsessing over my nvim and tmux configs
- And how to find my place in the world (that's the hard bit)

If you want to reach me, drop me an email at jacksonchristopherthomas@gmail.com
Or just ring me if you know me like that

Cya!
